No doubt Nike makes great shoes, but today we are going to take a critical look at the Nike Air Jordan 1.   Rather than review the styling from “Sneaker Freak” perspective or the performance of the shoe for actually playing basketball, I want to do comparison of the construction, materials and assembly the Original Air Jordan 1, the Retro Air Jordan 1 and the Nike ID Air Jordan 1.

A lot has been written about the Air Jordan 1, but I’m looking at a specific detail.  The edges!
How the shoe designer handles the material edges is critical to the look, costing and construction of a shoe design.   Today we are looking at 3 different versions of the same Classic Nike Air Jordan 1.  Each model of this shoe the Original Air Jordan 1, the Retro Air Jordan 1 and the Nike ID Air Jordan 1, all have a different edge treatments.  These three version of the Nike Air Jordan 1 each show the common material  edge treatments raw cut, rolled or turned out seam.
